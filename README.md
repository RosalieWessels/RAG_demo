**Question:** How much did Barbie bring in in box office?
**RAG:** 
Barbie brought in $1,441,724,962 in box office revenue.
**No RAG:** 
I'm not exactly sure about the box office revenue of a specific Barbie movie, as there have been several films featuring the character over the years. However, I can suggest that you might be referring to the 2023 live-action film "Barbie" starring Margot Robbie.

According to recent box office reports, the 2023 "Barbie" film has grossed over $1.4 billion worldwide. However, please note that these numbers may not be up-to-date or final, and I would recommend checking a reliable source for the most accurate information.
