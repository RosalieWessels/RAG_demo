I'm not exactly sure about the current box office numbers for the Barbie movie, as my knowledge cutoff is December 2023, and I might not have the most up-to-date information. However, I can suggest checking a reliable box office source, such as Box Office Mojo, for the most recent and accurate information on the Barbie movie's box office performance.
